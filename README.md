# üöÄ Mastering Filtering in Django REST Framework (DRF) with a Real-World Example

In this blog, we delve into building efficient and flexible filtering for Django REST Framework (DRF) APIs using `django-filter`. We explore various filtering techniques such as partial searches, filtering by specific fields, and handling date ranges‚Äîall within the context of a real-world project.

Whether you're building APIs that manage projects, users, or any other large dataset, effective filtering is crucial to allow users to retrieve the data they need quickly. With DRF and `django-filter`, you can implement robust filtering solutions in just a few steps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

To run the sample project from the blog, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/django-drf-filtering-example.git
    cd django-drf-filtering-example
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run migrations**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. **Load sample data** (optional):
    ```bash
    python manage.py loaddata sample_data.json
    ```

6. **Run the server**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

7. **Test the filtering functionality**:
    - Filter projects by name:
      ```
      /api/projects/?name=projectname
      ```
    - Filter projects by tech stack:
      ```
      /api/projects/?tech_stack=Python
      ```
    - Filter projects by creation date range:
      ```
      /api/projects/?created_at_after=2023-01-01&created_at_before=2023-12-31
      ```
